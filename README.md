# pi

**Calculating π in C# with various algorithms.**

The first video demonstrates François Viète's formula.
The precision is stuck currently by our lack of ability to calculate a square root with the `decimal` data type.

The second video introduces Heron's algorithm for calculating square roots.
This allows us to calculate a `decimal` value for Pi, but something mysterious is preventing accuracy to the full
precision made available to us.
